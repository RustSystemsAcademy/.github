# Rust Systems Academy — Mission & Purpose

Rust Systems Academy exists to advance the craft of systems programming using Rust.

## Our Purpose
- To provide high-quality, accessible training for developers at all skill levels.
- To promote correct, safe, and modern systems engineering practices.
- To build open-source systems-level libraries, tools, and frameworks.
- To offer “from zero to mastery” learning paths covering:
  - Rust fundamentals
  - Operating system internals
  - Memory models and concurrency
  - Networking and distributed systems
  - Systems security and sandboxing
  - High-performance computing and simulation

## Why We Exist
Modern systems software demands both **safety** and **performance**. Rust is uniquely positioned to deliver both, but the barrier to entry is high.

Rust Systems Academy aims to:
- Make expert-level knowledge accessible.
- Reduce the learning curve for systems engineers transitioning into Rust.
- Provide well-architected, production-quality code examples across domains.
- Encourage best practices for reliability, testing, and security.
